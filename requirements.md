# Airbnb Clone Backend Requirements Specification

This document details the functional and technical requirements for three core backend features of the Airbnb Clone project: User Authentication, Property Management, and Booking System. These specifications guide API development, validation, and performance expectations.

## 1. User Authentication

### Overview
Enables users (guests and hosts) to securely register, log in, and manage their accounts. Supports multiple authentication methods and ensures data privacy and security.

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                          | Request Body                      | Response                          |
|------------------------|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `/api/auth/register`   | POST   | Register new user                  | `{ email, password, name, role (guest|host), oauthProvider?, phone? }` | `{ userId, email, token }`        |
| `/api/auth/login`      | POST   | User login                        | `{ email, password }` or OAuth token | `{ userId, email, token }`        |
| `/api/auth/logout`     | POST   | Logout user                      | Authorization header (JWT)       | `{ message: "Logged out" }`       |
| `/api/auth/refresh`    | POST   | Refresh JWT token                 | Refresh token                   | `{ token }`                      |
| `/api/users/:id`       | GET    | Get user profile                 | Authorization header (JWT)       | `{ userId, name, email, role, ... }` |
| `/api/users/:id`       | PUT    | Update user profile              | Authorization header (JWT), `{ name?, phone?, paymentInfo? }` | `{ updatedUser }`                 |

### Input Validation Rules

- Email must be valid and unique.
- Password must be at least 8 characters, include uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.
- OAuth registration requires valid OAuth tokens.
- Phone number must be in E.164 format if provided.
- Role must be either `guest` or `host`.
- All inputs sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

### Output Specifications

- JWT tokens must include user ID, role, and expiration claims.
- Passwords are never returned in responses.
- Error responses include HTTP status codes and descriptive messages (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized).

### Performance Criteria

- Authentication endpoints must respond within 500ms under normal load.
- System must support at least 1000 concurrent login requests.
- Rate limiting: max 5 login attempts per minute per IP to prevent brute force attacks.

| `/api/properties`           | POST   | Create new property listing          | `{ title, description, location {city, address, coordinates}, pricePerNight, amenities[], availability[] }` | `{ propertyId, ...propertyData }` |
| `/api/properties/:id`       | GET    | Retrieve property details            | None                                                                                           | `{ propertyData }`               |
| `/api/properties/:id`       | PUT    | Update property listing              | `{ title?, description?, pricePerNight?, amenities?, availability? }`                          | `{ updatedProperty }`            |
| `/api/properties/:id`       | DELETE | Delete property listing              | Authorization header (JWT, host role)                                                          | `{ message: "Deleted" }`         |
| `/api/properties/search`    | GET    | Search properties with filters      | Query params: `location`, `priceMin`, `priceMax`, `amenities`, `guests`, `page`, `limit`       | `{ results[], totalCount }`      |

### Input Validation Rules

- Title and description are required and must be sanitized.
- Location must include valid city and address; coordinates optional but validated if present.
- Price per night must be a positive decimal.

### Performance Criteria

- Property search queries return results within 1 second for up to 10,000 listings.
- Support at least 500 concurrent property creation/update requests.
- Image uploads (if applicable) handled asynchronously and stored in cloud storage.

## General Non-Functional Requirements

- All APIs must use HTTPS and enforce authentication/authorization via JWT.

- Logging must capture key events for audit and debugging.
- System must comply with GDPR and other relevant data protection regulations.
